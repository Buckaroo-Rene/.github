# 🎉Welcome to Buckaroo
### Your strategic payment partner💳. For online payments, subscription solutions, marketplaces split-payments and more.

In 2005 Buckaroo started as the first iDEAL provider in the Netherlands. A little later, the option for SEPA direct debit and credit cards was added. Later that became more than 40 payment methods and gift cards. We are now a strategic payment partner for more than 5,000 organizations and companies. And we offer solutions for every payment issue. Every consumer wants to be able to pay quickly, easily and securely. A simple wish, but sometimes a big challenge in the changing world of ecommerce and digitization. Together with you, we look at where we can make a profit in the payment process.

### Most chosen payment solutions💸:
- Flexible checkout with choice of national and international payment methods
- Custom payment requests and payment reminders
- Automatic debtor management with Credit Management
- Collecting and managing subscriptions
- Ready-made integrations (plugins)
